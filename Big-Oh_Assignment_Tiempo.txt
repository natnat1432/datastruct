Assignment:

Item#1: 
The given Function below (sumofnumbersA, sumofnumbersB) computes the sum of  1-n.

Function A:
 public static long sumofnumbersA(long n){
	
        int sum = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++){
            sum +=i;
        }
        return sum;
    }

Function B:
   public static long sumofnumbersB(long n){
        return n * (n + 1) / 2;
   }

Plot the output in a table using the inputs below.
Note: you can measure ellapsed time using System.nanoTime()

Example:
long start_time = System.nanoTime();
sumofnumbersA(1000);
long time_elapsed = System.nanoTime() - start_time;



Table for function A
     input size                time(nano seconds)
1. n = 1000L        ------>      14900
2. n = 10000L       ------>      175500
3. n = 100000L      ------>      1219800
4. n = 1000000L     ------>      2335200 
5. n = 10000000L    ------>      7257000
6. n = 100000000L   ------>      52171200
7. n = 1000000000L  ------>      502963300

Table for function B
     input size                time(nano seconds)
1. n = 1000L        ------>      1600
2. n = 10000L       ------>      1700
3. n = 100000L      ------>      1700
4. n = 1000000L     ------>      1700 
5. n = 10000000L    ------>      2200
6. n = 100000000L   ------>      2000
7. n = 1000000000L  ------>      1800

note: L -> tell the java compiler to use "long" instead of "int"

Question: What have you observed between the two functions?

Function B's time is much lesser compared to function A which makes function B faster than Function A.


Item#2:
Your favorite past time is watching movies. You are planning to watch "Jason Bourne" series over the weekend.
The series consist of 4 movies(Bourne Identity, Bourne Supremacy, Bourne Ultimatum, Bourne Legacy) each roughly 7GB (super HD) in size.
You have a decision to make, either download the movie or purchase in a local movie store and have it delivered to your house.

Option 1 parameters:
Total download size: 7x4 = ~28GB
Internet speed: 0.2Mbps (Standard speed in PHL)
Total estimated time to download (days) = 13-14 days


Option 2 parameters:
Confirmation of order: 24hours but not more than 2 days
Delivery duration: 2 days
Total estimated delivery time =  worst case=6 days   best-case= 4 days


Question 1: Which option is better? explain.

Option 2 is better because even at the worst case scenario option 2 still has lesser waiting days compared to option 1.

Question 2: You already watched Jason Bourne series and now you want to watch "Star Wars" Series. Which option would you prefer?

I would prefer option two because the total time for downloading all star wars movie which consists of 12 movies equates to 41 days with a internet speed of 0.2 mbps assuming every movie's size is 7gb which is much longer compared to the worst case scenario of option 2 which is 6 days.
